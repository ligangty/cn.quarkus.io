"Proactive authentication is enabled in Quarkus by default.\n"
"It ensures that all incoming requests with credentials are authenticated, even if the target page does not require authentication.\n"

"You can turn off this default behavior if you want to authenticate only when the target page requires it.\n"
"To turn off proactive authentication so that authentication occurs only when the target page requires it, modify the `application.properties` configuration file as follows:"

"If you turn off proactive authentication, the authentication process runs only when an identity is requested.\n"
"An identity can be requested because of security rules that require the user to authenticate or because programmatic access to the current identity is required."

"If proactive authentication is used, accessing `SecurityIdentity` is a blocking operation.\n"
"This is because authentication might have yet to happen, and accessing `SecurityIdentity` might require calls to external systems, such as databases, that might block the operation.\n"
"For blocking applications, this is not an issue.\n"
"However, if you have disabled authentication in a reactive application, this fails because you cannot do blocking operations on the I/O thread.\n"
"To work around this, you need to `@Inject` an instance of `io.quarkus.security.identity.CurrentIdentityAssociation` and call the `Uni<SecurityIdentity> getDeferredIdentity();` method.\n"
"Then, you can subscribe to the resulting `Uni` to be notified when authentication is complete and the identity is available."

"You can still access `SecurityIdentity` synchronously with `public SecurityIdentity getIdentity()` in xref:resteasy-reactive.adoc[RESTEasy Reactive] from endpoints that are annotated with `@RolesAllowed`, `@Authenticated`, or with respective configuration authorization checks because authentication has already happened.\n"
"The same is also valid for xref:reactive-routes.adoc[Reactive routes] if a route response is synchronous."
msgstr "您仍然可以在 xref:resteasy-reactive.adoc[RESTEasy Reactive] 中通过 `public SecurityIdentity getIdentity()` 从注释为 `@RolesAllowed` 、 `@Authenticated` 或相应配置授权检查的端点同步访问 `SecurityIdentity` ，因为身份验证已经发生。如果路由响应是同步的，同样的情况也适用于 xref:reactive-routes.adoc[Reactive] 路由。"

"When proactive authentication is disabled, xref:security-authorize-web-endpoints-reference.adoc#standard-security-annotations[standard security annotations] used on CDI beans do not function on an I/O thread if a secured method that is not void synchronously returns a value.\n"

"Some HTTP authentication mechanisms must handle authentication exceptions themselves to create a correct authentication challenge.\n"
"For example, `io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.CodeAuthenticationMechanism`, which manages OpenID Connect (OIDC) authorization code flow authentication, must build a correct redirect URL and set a state cookie.\n"
"Therefore, avoid using custom exception mappers to customize authentication exceptions thrown by such mechanisms.\n"
"Instead, a safer approach is to ensure that proactive authentication is enabled and to use Vert.x HTTP route failure handlers.\n"
"This is because events come to the handler with the correct response status and headers.\n"
"Then, you must only customize the response; for example:"
