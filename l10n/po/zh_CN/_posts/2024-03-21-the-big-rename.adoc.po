msgid "Recently, we've made a decision to rename several Quarkus extensions that previously included the word \"reactive\" in their names. This blog post aims to shed light on the reasoning behind this change and what it means for you as a user and/or extension author."

msgid "Quarkus is about providing a modern, efficient, and productive development experience for developers leveraging the JVM. We're committed to making it easier for you to build cloud-native applications, whether you're using traditional blocking, reactive, or virtual thread-based programming models."

#: _posts/2024-03-21-the-big-rename.adoc
msgid "Historically, Quarkus has used the term \"reactive\" in the names of several extensions to indicate their *additional* support for non-blocking, event-driven programming."

"However, we've found that this terminology has led to lots of confusion and misunderstanding among our users.\n"
"Many users mistakenly believe that using these \"reactive\" extensions forces them into reactive programming, even though Quarkus, by default, recommends the traditional blocking programming model for your application and only use the reactive programming model if you have needs for it (like high concurrency requirement, or the need to orchestrate many asynchronous tasks)."

msgstr ""

#: _posts/2024-03-21-the-big-rename.adoc
msgid "For most projects, this renaming should not require changes, except for those having used `quarkus-rest-client` it may require some adjustments in your dependencies. We're committed to making this transition as smooth as possible. Here are a few key points to help you adapt:"

#: _posts/2024-03-21-the-big-rename.adoc

msgid "If you've developed a Quarkus extension and want to stay compatible with Quarkus LTS releases while supporting the newer versions, we recommend keeping the old names as aliases for the new ones. This will ensure that your extension remains compatible with older Quarkus versions. Relocations solve this."
