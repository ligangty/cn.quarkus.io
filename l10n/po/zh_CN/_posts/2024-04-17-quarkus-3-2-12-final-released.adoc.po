"It should be a safe upgrade for anyone already using a 3.2.11.Final release. However, the fix for CVE-2024-2700 introduces a change in how configuration options are recoded at build time and should be taken into account.\n"
"More specifically, properties from configuration sources that are considered local (those that are available at build time but not runtime, such as environment variables, system properties, Maven and Gradle project properties) will not override the default values of runtime configuration properties. This is done to avoid leaking local environment values into production builds."
